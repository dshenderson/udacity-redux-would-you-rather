# Would you rather...?

This is the project for the Redux portion of Udacity's React Nanodegree programme.

After choosing a login handle, the user is presented with a list of questions. Each question asks, "Would you
rather...?", and presents two options. The user must select one answer.  The user can also ask his or her own
questions. When a question is answered, then and only then can you see how others have answered the question.
The leaderboard allows you to see where users rank in terms of asked and answered questions.
